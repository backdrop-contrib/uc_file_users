Ubercart File Users
======================

This module contains some administrative tools for store managers whose Ubercart stores have file downloads enabled.

Installation
------------

- Install this module using [the official Backdrop CMS instructions](https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules).

- Visit the administration page under Administration > Store > Products >
  View file users (admin/store/products/file-users).

Currently, this module provides the following information:

* The number of users who can download a specified file;
* A detailed list of all users who can download a specified file;
* The ability to copy the email addresses of all users who can download a specified file. You can use this information to send an email to everyone who has downloaded a file (if, for example, a new version of the file has been posted).

Further functionality may be added based on feature requests (see next).
